Hi there! This repo is about my journey in reading the Redux source code. It's raw. It's honest. However, I must admit that it's lengthy. If I were to teach someone Redux with a limited amount of time, I certainly would change quite a few things around. But, I think it's still valid and important to have a series like this. I believe the messy is sometimes just as valuable. 

Given that my knowledge is limited, I hope you can forgive any mistakes that I might have made. You can reach me and provide your honest feedback via email: ryan.weihao.di@gmail.com.

I hope you enjoy the series and that it's worth of your time.
